But compliance with federal law is baseline. Notably, the FLSA has an overtime exemption for certain residential childcare workers in nonprofit institutions, but a regular for-profit daycare must pay overtime. Additionally, under federal law, live-in employees (if any) have different overtime rules. Daycares should also post the federal \"Employee Rights\" poster. In general, by following California labor laws, the daycare will meet FLSA standards."

Because daycares have responsibilities to the children, many safety measures (like earthquake drills, first aid kits, etc.) also serve to protect employees. Cal/OSHA could inspect if there are complaints, but routine inspections are uncommon in this low-hazard industry. Still, the daycare must comply with OSHA standards (for example, recordkeeping if it has >10 employees, and reporting any serious employee injuries)."
